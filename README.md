Text Completions with the power of AI.


## Introduction

Comps is a project that uses the OpenAI Completions API to provide a powerful
 autocomplete experience. It is written in Java 7, so can be easily integrated
 into your project. To get started, you need to have an OpenAI API Key, Java 7
 or later installed  on your computer and then you can run comps by using the
 command:

 `java -jar comps-<version>.jar`

The OpenAI Completions API uses a cutting-edge machine learning algorithm that
 can generate human-level completions of text. With Comps, you can use the API
 to automatically complete any sentence you type in. Comps will use the OpenAI
 Completions API to parse your sentence and generate intelligent suggestions
 that can help you finish the sentence.

To use Comps, simply type your sentence or phrase into the terminal. Comps will
 then generate several suggestions for completing it, along with a confidence 
 score for each suggestion. You can then choose the suggested completion with the
 highest confidence score, or you can type in your own.

Comps is a powerful tool for quickly autocompleting text, and it can be used to
 great effect in many different applications.
